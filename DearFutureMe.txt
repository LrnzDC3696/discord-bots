Hi future me!

I am sorry for making this hard on you but I was supper lazy to create the docs for you to read.
I know I am a lazy fck but please understand that I am growing.
I sincerely apologize for this behaviour I wish for you to make the docstring and help other people
to read this code.

My requests to you:
  Could you also improve the code and fix bugs if there ever is one.
  Could you please set a workflow for checking bugs.
  Could you please also make a unit testing if possible to you won't have to suffer.
